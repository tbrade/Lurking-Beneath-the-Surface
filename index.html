  <h2 class= "heading">African clawed frogs: An Introduction</h2>
  <p>African clawed frogs are a primarily aquatic amphibian native to sub-Saharan Africa, but they have been transported around the world as pets and laboratory animals.  These frogs have been known to invade new habitats after being released by humans accidentally and intentionally into the environment. African clawed frogs have been spotted in Western Washington and are starting to establish themselves which is a serious problem.
  <h2 class= "heading"> Why are African clawed frogs a problem? </h2>
  <p> - African clawed frogs are opportunistic predators and could feed on a variety of native invertibrates, frogs and even small fish.  Native species such as Pacific chorus frogs, Western Toads and trout and salmon fry are likely on the menu.
  <p> - African clawed frogs are asymptomatic carriers of a deadly fungus known as (Bd) or the Chytrid fungus.  This fungus has killed thousands of amphibians across the world and it is speculated that the African clawed frog was one of the first carriers of the disease.  The spread of the African clawed frog could mean the further spread of the fungus throughout Western Washington.  In addition, it is possible for the African clawed frog to be a vector for Ranaviruses which have the potential to harm native fish such as salmon.</p>
  <p> - Western Washington's temperate climate could make it possible for the African clawed frog to reproduce for a significant portion of the year.  Rainstorms in Western Washington may allow the African clawed frog to leave its aquatic habitat just long enough to find new homes in other waterbodies.</p>
  <h2 class= "heading"> An Alien Invader</h2>
  <p> Compared to what people would normally think a frog looks like, the African clawed frog has some significant differences.  Firstly, the African clawed frog has no tongue.  This means that the African clawed frog has to either consume prey whole or use its cornified tips on its back feet (where the name "clawed" comes from) to tear apart large prey.  To find prey, African clawed frogs use the two lines of ribbed sensory nerves on the sides of its body to detect movement in the water.  The eyes are positioned on the top of the head with no eyelids in contrast to on the side of the head with eyelids.  The placement of the eyes is most likely an adaptation to being a bottom dweller in waterbodies.  Having no vocal cords, you will not hear this frog call above the surface.  Instead, African clawed frogs call to each other underwater using a series of fast clicking sounds.  The frogs display sexual dimorphisim, where males are significantly smaller than females.  Mature females are about the length of an outstretched adult hand, while the length of mature males are a little bit less than the length of a pinky finger.  The colors of African clawed frogs are typically a latticework of black and brown spots and lines on top of the frog with a cream colored underbelly.  African clawed frogs can darken their appearence when threatened to blend into their surroundings.
  </p>
  <h2 class = "heading"> Prefered Habitat and Where They are Now </h2>
  <p> African clawed frogs tend to live on the bottom of stagnant ponds and waterbodies but they have been spotted in flowing streams as well in other invaded environments.  In other countries where African clawed frogs have invaded, the African clawed frog has been able to exploit both human infrastructure such as irrigation canals and ponds created by dams, as well as natural wetlands.  So far in Western Washington, African clawed frogs have taken advantage of stormwater ponds in the cities of Lacey, Bothell and Issaquah.  Due to the cryptic nature of the frogs, it is very possible that they are more widespread than currently known.  The image of the model below represents a conservative estimate on where these frogs could establish (red is more suitable, blue is not as suitable or very low suitability.  The purple square represents a known African clawed frog location used to train the model while the white squares represent African clawed frog locations used to train the model.)</p>

  <p>  The model took into consideration annual mean temperature, annual precipitation, maximum temperature of the warmest month and precipitation of driest month (The purple square represents a known African clawed frog location used to train the model while the white squares represent African clawed frog locations used to train the model.). As can be seen in the model, most of lowland Western Washington is moderately suitable to highly suitable for the African clawed frog.</p>

  <h2 class= "heading">How can I help?</h2>
  <p>If you see an African clawed frog report it to the Washington Invasive Species Council on the website below:</p>
  <center><b><a href = "https://invasivespecies.wa.gov/priorityspecies/african-clawed-frog/">African clawed frog Reporting</a></b></center>
  <p>The best chance of seeing an African clawed frog is probably in the spring through early fall months during or just after a rainstorm.  They may be leaving their local pond or waterbody in search of a new one.</p>
  <p>If you own an African clawed frog, please consult the website below to determine the best course of action:</p>
